# learn-terraform on GCP platform
My personal notes to learn terraform-GCP


1. Generate private key for an existing service account of the project or create new SA and generate the key 
2. Get the key from previous step and store it in the folder for terrafrom
3. Populate provider.tf, main.tf, etc files and update project-id, resource names, etc.
